# Machine Learning Notebook Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook implementing foundational concepts in machine learning. Below is an overview of the contents and functionality of the notebook:

## Key Features

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**
   - Utilizes popular libraries like `pandas` and `numpy` for data manipulation.
   - Handles missing values and normalizes datasets to prepare for model training.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Employs descriptive statistics and visualizations using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.
   - Includes correlation analysis, distribution plots, and feature importance.

3. **Model Implementation**
   - Implements supervised learning algorithms such as:
     - Linear Regression
     - Logistic Regression
     - Decision Trees
     - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
   - Utilizes `scikit-learn` for model building, training, and evaluation.

4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**
   - Includes examples of hyperparameter optimization using GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV.

5. **Evaluation Metrics**
   - Computes various performance metrics, such as:
     - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
     - Accuracy
     - Precision, Recall, and F1-score
     - Confusion Matrix

6. **Model Deployment Insights**
   - Provides insights into saving models with `joblib` or `pickle` for deployment purposes.
